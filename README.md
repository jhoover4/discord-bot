# Discord Bot

I'm practicing Rust be creating a discord bot for my friends :).

Stack includes: [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [shuttle](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/welcome).

## Current Features

- Send inspiring message to body-improvement-club channel
- Create a `/map` command that will return a google map url to the users residence or to spots we frequent often.

## Ideas

- Benji quote generator?
- Keep track of RDI/frisbee wins?
- Book club pop up, that keeps track of current book, links it to Goodreads page, next meeting, and shows how we're gonna slice it up
