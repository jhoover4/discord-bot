# Discord Bot

I'm practicing Rust be creating a discord bot for my friends :).

Stack includes: [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [shuttle](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/welcome).

## Current Features

- Send message to channel every week to remind us of D&D day
- Create a `/map` command that will return a google map url to the users residence or to spots we frequent often.
- Respond "shockingly" to Andrew's posts.
